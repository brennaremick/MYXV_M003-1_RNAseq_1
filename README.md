# MYXV_M003-1_RNAseq_1
Code in this repository was used to analyze RNA-seq data from MYD88/TRIF KO BLaER1 monocytes expressing myxoma virus M003.1; from the manuscript: "Attack of host anti-viral pathways by a myxoma virus virulence factor unleashes effector-triggered NF-ÎºB signaling"

File descriptions:
